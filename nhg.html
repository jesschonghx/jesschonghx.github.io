        <h3 class="project-description-title">About</h3>
        <p class="project-description-text">
          As part of Singapore’ s national initiative, Healthier Sg, the
          Partners’ portal was developed. It aims to connect residents to
          community care and centralise programme management for NHG’s (National
          Healthcare Group) community partners. Through the Partners’ portal,
          community partners can upload their programmes which are accessible by
          residents via the NHG Cares App.

        <h3 class="project-description-title">Gathering Requirements</h3>
        <p class="project-description-text">
          To understand the requirements, we held meetings with NHG users to
          explore their structure, needs, and challenges. While NHG users wanted
          tools to share and visualise information, community partners needed to
          track attendance, view data, and issue certificates. Another challenge
          was to make sure that our design would allow for the synchronisation
          of data across different platforms i.e. our database to NHG’s
          Population Health CRM. <br />
          <br />
          Using FigJam, we mapped out user flows based on these insights,
          aligning with stakeholders before starting the design phase.

        <p class="project-description-text">
          To ensure that we were on the right path, we explored apps in the
          fitness industry with Healthy365, ClassPass, and TeamUp identified as
          potential benchmarks. Due to limited access to Healthy365's vendor
          application, we focused on ClassPass and TeamUp.
          <br /><br />
          A heuristic evaluation was conducted based on collected screenshots to
          assess their usability and features. We then applied what we thought
          would be feasible for our project.

        <h3 class="project-description-title">Explicit Listening</h3>
        <p class="project-description-text">
          In his book “Articulating Design Decisions”, Greever talked about
          explicit listening, which are explicit activities we use to improve
          our listening. For meetings, this can come in the form of taking
          notes, repeating and rephrasing what you have heard.
          <br /><br />Though we were already taking minutes, the notes were long
          and we often find ourselves lost in the sea of information. I wanted
          to take better notes to get the most out of the meetings, hence I
          added some tweaks to make sure my notes are: <br /><br />• Accessible
          - Notes are shared in the Notion project folder <br /><br />•
          Organised - Headings and bullet points <br /><br />• Definitive - When
          a decision is made, make it explicitly clear i.e. Final: Remove button
          <br /><br />• Actionable - Include a follow-up action section, and the
          person in charge <br /><br />
          • Forward looking - Highlight certain points that may be up for
          discussion in the next &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting
          <br /><br />This proved to be very useful when we need to revisit our
          meeting minutes to follow up on work.

          We began creating high-fidelity wireframes after mapping out user
          flows and aligning them with stakeholders. <br /><br />

          Since we couldn’t directly engage with the community partners—the
          primary users of the application—we continuously asked ourselves as we
          design: Who are the users, and what are their tasks and workflows?
          <br /><br />

          We also made sure to create visual hierarchy on the page to help guide
          the community partners through a page.

        <h3 class="project-description-title">UAT and Launch</h3>
        <p class="project-description-text">
          Once the product was developed, we conducted User Acceptance Testing
          (UAT) based on a detailed UAT brief outlining various scenarios. The
          testing group included NHG users and community partners from the Tsao
          Foundation and AWWA (Asian Women’s Welfare Association).
          <br /><br />
          During the testing, I worked closely with users, guiding them through
          the test cases to ensure a smooth process. All bugs, issues, and
          feedback were documented and shared with the team for prioritisation
          and delegation.
          <br /><br />
          Following multiple UAT sessions and iterative fixes, the application
          successfully launched in April 2024. It onboarded over 20 community
          partners, streamlining more than 400 programs across approximately 100
          sites in Central and North Singapore. The launch was also highlighted
          on GovInsider, showcasing its impact on integrating health and social
          ecosystems (Read more).

        <h3 class="project-description-title">Learnings</h3>
        <p class="project-description-text">
          Working on this project gave me invaluable experience collaborating
          with external stakeholders—a process that was both challenging and
          rewarding.
          <br /><br />
          One practice I embraced was leading with a "Yes"—acknowledging
          stakeholder input positively by saying, “Yes, that’s a good point.” or
          “Yes, I understand where you are coming from.” This approach fosters
          collaboration, reinforcing that we’re all on the same team working
          toward the same goals. It doesn’t imply immediate commitment but
          conveys that their contributions are valued.
          <br /><br />
          I also learnt the importance of resourcefulness. When user testing
          wasn’t feasible, I sought alternative ways to design effectively. This
          included focusing on understanding the goals and priorities of target
          users and constantly reflecting on how community partners would use
          the application in real-world scenarios.
